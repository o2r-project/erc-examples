abstract: "Automatic forecasts of large numbers of univariate time series are often needed in business and other contexts. We describe two automatic forecasting algorithms that have been implemented in the forecast package for R. The first is based on innovations state space models that underly exponential smoothing methods. The second is a step-wise algorithm for forecasting with ARIMA models. The algorithms are applicable to both seasonal and non-seasonal data, and are compared and illustrated using four real time series. We also briefly describe some of the other functionality available in the forecast package."

## EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING

etsfit <- ets(usnetelec, model)
fit3 <- ets(ukcars, model)
fit4 <- ets(visitors, model)

# Figure 1
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(forecast(fit1),xlab="Year",ylab="Percentage per annum",main="(a) US 10-year bonds yield")
plot(forecast(etsfit),xlab="Year",ylab="Billion kwh",main="(b) US net electricity generation")
plot(forecast(fit3),xlab="Year",ylab="Thousands of cars",main="(c) UK passenger motor vehicle production")
plot(forecast(fit4),xlab="Year",ylab="Thousands of people",main="(d) Overseas visitors to Australia")

# Print the model for US net electricity

# In-sample accuracy of model
accuracy(etsfit)
# Compute forecasts from the model
fcast <- forecast(etsfit)
# Plot the forecasts with prediction intervals
plot(fcast)
# Print the forecasts
fcast
# Fit an ETS model to the first 45 months
fit <- ets(usnetelec[1:45])
# Apply the same model to the last 10 months without re-estimating the parameters
test <- ets(usnetelec[46:55],model=fit)
# Look at the in-sample accuracy

# Look at the out-of-sample accuracy

## ARIMA MODELLING

arimafit <- auto.arima(usnetelec)
aafit3 <- auto.arima(ukcars,approximation=FALSE)
aafit4 <- auto.arima(log(visitors),approximation=FALSE)

# Forecast from the ARIMA model
fcast <- forecast(arimafit)
# Plot the forecasts
plot(fcast)
# Summary of the forecasts
summary(fcast)

# Figure 2
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
