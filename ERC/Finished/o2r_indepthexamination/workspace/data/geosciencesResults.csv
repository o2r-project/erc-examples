The equations needed to reproduce what we did are usually given in the paper, together with the measured data (at least in plots), as well as values for all parameters used, so some questions didn't make sense (I work in the laboratory on fundamental process understanding). Indeed, older papers (some decades old) often miss some crucial values to reproduce the results, but my feeling is that this has changed, anyway, in the field I work in.

However, I see lots of practical problems in actually realizing that:

- long-term storage of large low processing level observational data sets. We get many results from processing Terabytes of raw (Level0, Level 1) spectral data which is not in a publicly accessible data base (only the Level2 data product is).
- archiving a complete computing environment with a publication. I can see that people can provide virtual machines that run some scripts. But how would I provide the computing environment of a huge HPC system (which is replaced every 3-5 years) with a publication?
- the effort it takes to get something that runs on your local system to run on somebody else's system (even with VMs)
- the longevity of systems like Github which could be shut down any time for any reason."

I think DOI numbers are great but I worry about the existence of multiple identical data sets submitted to different archives (perhaps with different meta data based on institute/archive requirements) having different DOI numbers.  It seems critical to me that meta-data information include information on all of the archives that data have been submitted to and for a given data set indicate whether there is more than one DOI number that may represent the numerical data.

Instead we work in model inter-comparison projects and try to discuss similarities and differences between model results. I do agree that we lack behind and that this is not enough for scientific work to be truly scientific, but it's the only practical solution for now with the present funding conditions. I coordinate a EU funded project called PROJECT NAME where we currently address these issues in RESEARCH FIELD and we are about to launch a virtual water science Lab to increase transparency and stimulate collaborative projects using the same data and source codes. It would be nice to see if we can link out efforts between projects in some way?"

Access to code, data etc .... is a bonus.  If the work could not, in theory, be recreated it is not science!

I have sent two of my papers to you by e-mail, which work to make geomorphology more transparent and reproducible.  The data underlying them (i.e. the modified DEM) are copyright, but the method is described so that work could be reproduced and tested if equivalent data were obtained and the method used followed.

There is a lot of pressure on publishing, especially in quantity. A fully open system to reproduce results, eventually mark (by the publisher on a community database) non-reproducible results might help to a) improve also the quality of research papers (especially given the fairly low scientific quality of many contributions in the most highly ranked journals in my field) b) prevent wasting time reading contributions just to realize that they might not be the most reproducible research (and everyone doing re-invents the wheel again)."

The R-package is just one among many statistical tools/software, and not everyone uses it.
Reproducibility of plots, graphs, statistics is not the key issue; the problem is reproducibility of results, no matter what type of software and/or analysis tools are being used. For instance, in our field (geophysics --> seismology --> earthquake physics), there are many (large-scale, often HPC-enabled) codes for solving a specific problem (say, seismic wave propagation in heterogeneous media). The type of code, programming language, implementation, platform etc don't matter, as long as the physics is correctly represented (implemented) and the resulting time-series (or whatever output) are identical (within the numerical accuracy). Not every researchers has access to the needed computational facilities, but may choose a code that suits their hardware. Reproducibility is part of the chain ""verification, validation, transparency"" in science, and thus requires a broader context / approach. "

This is a common problem when upgrading HPCs for example. So I think ""reproducibility"" should be taken broadly, i.e. in a semi-quantitative manner. 
Another obstacle to source code availability is licensing: developing a large numerical model, of the Earth System for example, represents a massive effort and investment, and it is normal to expect that some research institute will not allow their code to be distributed on a open-source basis."
