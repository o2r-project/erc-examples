abstract: "Human and hydrological systems are coupled: human activity impacts the hydrological cycle and hydrological conditions can, but do not always, trigger changes in human systems. Traditional modeling approaches with no feedback between hydrological and human systems typically cannot offer insight into how different patterns of natural variability or human-induced changes may propagate through this coupled system. Modeling of coupled human–hydrological systems, also called socio-hydrological systems, recognizes the potential for humans to transform hydrological systems and for hydrological conditions to influence human behavior. However, this coupling introduces new challenges and existing literature does not offer clear guidance regarding model conceptualization. There are no universally accepted laws of human behavior as there are for the physical systems; furthermore, a shared understanding of important processes within the field is often used to develop hydrological models, but there is no such consensus on the relevant processes in socio-hydrological systems. Here we present a question driven process to address these challenges. Such an approach allows modeling structure, scope and detail to remain contingent on and adaptive to the question context. We demonstrate the utility of this process by revisiting a classic question in water resources engineering on reservoir operation rules: what is the impact of reservoir operation policy on the reliability of water supply for a growing city? Our example model couples hydrological and human systems by linking the rate of demand decreases to the past reliability to compare standard operating policy (SOP) with hedging policy (HP). The model shows that reservoir storage acts both as a buffer for variability and as a delay triggering oscillations around a sustainable level of demand. HP reduces the threshold for action thereby decreasing the delay and the oscillation effect. As a result, per capita demand decreases during periods of water stress are more frequent but less drastic and the additive effect of small adjustments decreases the tendency of the system to overshoot available supplies. This distinction between the two policies was not apparent using a traditional noncoupled model."

#1 Introduction
Humans both respond to and ignore changes in environmental conditions. While humans depend on the natural hydrological cycle to supply water for both personal and economic health (Falkenmark, 1977), they also depend on an array of other natural and human resources to maintain and grow communities. At times water availability can act as the limiting constraint, locally preventing or stalling the expansion of human activity. For example, water availability and variability constrained agricultural development in the Tarim River basin in western China before major water storage and transport infrastructure was constructed (Liu et al., 2014). At
other times the water-related risks rise in the background, disconnected from decision making, while other priorities prevail. For instance, the level of the Aral Sea has continued to decline for decades imposing significant costs on adjacent communities but no coordinated effort to stop the decline emerged (Micklin, 2007). At still other times public policy
decisions may work to exacerbate water problems, as when decisions are made to keep municipal water prices artificially low or when “senior water rights” encourage water usage in
the face of shortages (Chong and Sunding, 2006; Hughes et al., 2013; Mini et al., 2014).
Human and hydrological systems are coupled. Many impacts of human activity on the hydrological system are now well documented (Tong and Chen, 2002; Wissmar et al., 2004; Vörösmarty et al., 2010; Vahmani and Hogue, 2014) and there is increasing evidence that how and when humans respond individually and collectively to hydrological change has important implications for water resources planning, management and policy (Srinivasan et al., 2010; Di
Baldassarre et al., 2013; Elshafei et al., 2014). These observations
have prompted a call to treat humans as an endogenous
component of the water cycle (Wagener et al., 2010;
Sivapalan et al., 2012). Representing water systems as coupled
human–hydrological systems or socio-hydrological systems
with two-way feedback allows new research questions
and potentially transformative insights to emerge.
Traditional modeling approaches assume that there is no
feedback between hydrological and human systems and,
therefore, cannot provide insights into how different patterns
of natural variability or human-induced change may propagate
through the coupled system. Over short timescales,
such as a year, many human and hydrological variables
can be considered constant and their couplings may be ignored
(Srinivasan, 2015). However, water resources infrastructure
decisions have impacts on longer (decadal to century)
timescales; therefore, there is a need for an approach
that can handle not only long-term variability and nonstationarity
in the driving variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature,
population) but also addresses how these changes can
propagate through the coupled system, affecting the structure
and properties of the coupled system (Sivapalan et al.,
2012; Thompson et al., 2013). Dynamic modeling of sociohydrological
systems recognizes the potential for humans to
transform hydrological systems and for hydrological conditions
to influence human behavior. While human behavior
is usually incorporated into a model through scenarios, scenarios
cannot include two-way feedback. Building effects of
human behavior into a simulation model can enable testing
of feedback cycles and can illuminate the impact of feedback
and path dependencies that are not easily identifiable in
scenario-based modeling.
Coupled modeling, on the other hand, introduces new
challenges. First, it is not possible to exhaustively model
complex systems such as the coupled human–hydrological
system (Sterman, 2000; Schlüter et al., 2014). Bounds must
be set to develop an effective model but researchers are challenged
to objectively define the scope of coupled modeling
studies. Second, by definition coupled models cross disciplines
and modelers are unable to point to the theoretical
framework of any single discipline to defend the relevant
scope (Srinivasan, 2015). At the same time researchers must
balance the scope and level of detail in order to create a
parsimonious and communicable model. Finally, critical assessment
of models is more challenging when the theories,
empirical methods and vocabulary drawn upon to create and
communicate a model span disciplinary boundaries (Schlüter et al., 2014). At the same time, critique is needed to move
the field forward as the science is new and lacks established
protocols. Transparency of the model aims, the development
process, conceptual framework and assumptions are thus particularly
important. A structured but flexible modeling process
can address these challenges by encouraging modelers
to clearly define model objectives, document reasoning behind
choices of scale, scope and detail, and take a broad view
of potentially influential system processes.
In this paper we present a question driven process for modeling
socio-hydrological systems that builds on current modeling
tools from both domains and allows the flexibility for
exploration.We demonstrate this process by revisiting a classic
question in water resources engineering on reservoir operation
rules: the tradeoff between standard operating policy
(SOP) and hedging policy (HP). Under SOP, demand is fulfilled
unless available supply drops below demand; under HP,
water releases are reduced in anticipation of a deficit to decrease
the risk a large shortfall (Cancelliere et al., 1998). We
add to this classic question a linkage between supply reliability
and demand. As this question has been asked by numerous
researchers before, it offers an excellent opportunity
to test the utility of our proposed modeling framework using
a hypothetical municipality called Sunshine City as a case
study.

#2 Modeling socio-hydrological systems

Modeling the interactions between human and hydrological
systems exacerbates challenges found in modeling purely hydrological
systems including setting the model boundary, determining
the relevant processes and relationships and clearly
communicating model framing and assumptions. Common
approaches to hydrological modeling are reviewed to put
socio-hydrological modeling in the context of hydrological
modeling practice. Next, modeling approaches used in system
dynamics and social-ecological systems science, both
of which address coupled systems, are described. Then,
socio-hydrological modeling approaches are reviewed and
gaps identified. While no one approach is directly transferrable
to socio-hydrological systems, practices from hydrological
modeling, along with those from integrative disciplines,
serve as a baseline for comparison and inform our
socio-hydrological modeling process. We then present our
recommendations for socio-hydrological model conceptualization.

##2.1 Modeling hydrological systems
In hydrology the basic steps of model development are
(a) data collection and analysis, (b) conceptual model development,
(c) translation of the conceptual model to a mathematical
model, (d) model calibration and (e) model validation
(Blöschl and Sivapalan, 1995). While the basic steps of model development are generally accepted, in practice
approaches diverge, particularly in conceptual model development.
In hydrology, Wheater et al. (1993) identified
four commonly used modeling approaches: physics-based,
concept-based (also called conceptual), data driven and hybrid
data–conceptual. Physics-based models represent a system
by linking small-scale hydrological processes (Sivapalan
et al., 2003). Concept-based models use prior knowledge to
specify the influential processes and determine the structure.
Data driven models are derived primarily from observations
and do not specify the response mechanism. Hybrid data–
conceptual models use data and prior knowledge to infer
model structure (Wheater et al., 1993; Sivapalan et al., 2003).
Modeling purpose typically determines the modeling approach.
Environmental models may be developed to formulate
and test theories or to make predictions (Beven, 2002).
Physics-based models can be used to test theories about
small-scale processes or to predict catchment response by
scaling up these processes. Concept-based models hypothesize
the important elements and processes and their structure
of interaction to answer a question or predict a certain
property, although hypotheses are often not explicitly stated
and tested (Wheater et al., 1993). A reliance on prior knowledge
limits the applicability of concept-based modeling in
fields lacking consensus on both the presence and relevance
of feedback processes. Data driven models are effective in
prediction. While they have potential for hypothesis testing,
a focus on black box input–output models limits insight into
system processes and the ability to extrapolate beyond observed
data (Sivapalan et al., 2003). Hybrid data–conceptual
models use data and other knowledge to generate and test
hypotheses about the structure of the system (Wheater et al.,
1993; Young, 2003). As socio-hydrology is a new area of research,
prior knowledge alone is insufficient and the focus
is on modeling to enhance understanding through hypothesis
generation and testing; hybrid data–conceptual modeling tactics
aimed at enhancing understanding therefore inform our
proposed process.

##2.2 Modeling coupled systems
While coupling of natural and human systems is in its infancy
in hydrology, there is a strong tradition of studying
coupled systems in the fields of system dynamics and socialecological
systems. These fields have developed approaches
to understand and model complex systems and can inform
a socio-hydrological modeling process. First, in both fields
the research question or problem drives modeling decisions.
Much of the work to date on socio-hydrological systems is
exploratory and aims to explain evidence of system coupling
seen in case data. Developing a model to answer a question
or solve a problem allows a more structured and defensible
framework to support the modeling decisions and provides
a benchmark for model validation (Sterman, 2000; Hinkel
et al., 2015). For example, Jones et al. (2002), in modeling the sawmill industry in the northeastern United States focus
on understanding if the system has the structural potential to
overshoot sustainable yield. While the resulting model is a
significant simplification of a complex system, the reason for
inclusion of tree growth dynamics, mill capacity and lumber
prices and the exclusion of other variables is clear. Second,
system dynamics and social-ecological systems science use
multiple data sources, both quantitative and qualitative, to
specify and parameterize model relationships. Omitting influential
relationships or decision points due to lack of quantitative
data results in a greater error than their incorrect specification
(Forrester, 1992). Third, system dynamics focuses
on developing a dynamic hypothesis that explains the system
behavior of interest in terms of feedback processes (Sterman,
2000). Finally, social-ecological systems science has found
that the use of frameworks as part of a structured model development
process can aid transparency and comparability
across models (Schlüter et al., 2014).

##2.3 Progress and gaps in socio-hydrological modeling
Several research teams have operationalized the concepts
of socio-hydrology using approaches ranging from simple
generic models to contextual data-driven models. Di Baldassarre
et al. (2013) developed a simple generic model to explore
the dynamics of human–flood interactions for the purpose
of showing that human responses to floods can exacerbate
flooding problems. Viglione et al. (2014) extended this
work to test the impact of collective memory, risk-taking attitude
and trust in risk reduction measures on human–flood dynamics.
Kandasamy et al. (2014) analyzed the past 100 years
of development in the Murrumbidgee River basin in eastern
Australia and built a simple model of the transition from the
dominance of agricultural development goals, through a slow
realization of adverse environmental impacts, to emergence
of serious ecological restoration efforts. Elshafei et al. (2014)
proposed a conceptual socio-hydrological model for agricultural
catchments and applied it to the Murrumbidgee and the
Lake Toolibin basins; they then built upon this conceptual
model to construct a detailed semi-distributed model of the
Lake Toolibin basin (Elshafei et al., 2015). Srinivasan and
collaborators analyzed water security in the city of Chennai,
India. By modeling the feedback between household level
coping mechanisms and regional-scale stressors, the team explained
the counterintuitive effects of policy responses such
as the observation that reduced groundwater recharge caused
by fixing leaky pipelines decreased a household’s ability to
use wells to cope with water system interruptions (Srinivasan
et al., 2010, 2013).
Researchers have also addressed the methodological questions
of how to frame and model socio-hydrological systems.
Blair and Buytaert (2015), provide a detailed review
of the model types and modeling methods used in sociohydrology
and those that may have utility in the field. Sivapalan
and Blösch (2015) offer guidance on framing and modeling socio-hydrological systems from stating framing assumptions
to model validation techniques and highlight the
specific challenges of scale interactions found in these coupled
systems. Elshafei et al. (2014) and Liu et al. (2014) detailed
the development of conceptual models, giving readers
insight into the framing of their case study work.
These methodological advances have begun to address the
many challenges of translating the concept of feedback between
human and hydrological systems into actionable science.
However, obstacles remain: principally, expanding the
scope of modeling to include societal systems and human
decision-making exacerbates the challenges of setting the
model boundary and process detail, and of evaluating those
choices. The source of this challenge is twofold. First, there
are fundamental differences between natural and social systems.
The laws governing physical, chemical and biological
systems such as conservation of mass and energy are broadly
applicable across contexts; the relevance of rules influencing
social systems varies by context. Second, the modeling
of coupled human–hydrological systems is new intellectual
territory. At this intersection the norms and unstated assumptions
instilled by disciplinary training must be actively questioned
and examined within a transparent model development,
testing and validation process.
There are no universally accepted laws of human behavior
as there are for the physical and biological sciences (Loucks,
2015). While institutions (formal and informal rules) influence
behavior, the impact of institutions on the state of the
system depends on whether people follow the rules (Schlager
and Heikkila, 2011). Additionally, these rules are not static.
In response to outcomes of past decisions or changing conditions,
actors change both the rules that shape the options
available for practical decisions and the rules governing the
collective choice process through which these operation rules
are made (McGinnis, 2011). Furthermore, water policy decisions
are not made in isolation of other policy decisions.
Decisions are interlinked as the same actors may interact
with and get affected differently depending on the contexts
(McGinnis, 2011b). The outcome of a related policy decision
may alter the choices available to actors or the resources
available to address the current problem. The state of the hydrological
system, particularly during extreme events, can
spark institutional changes; yet, other factors such as political
support and financial resources as well as the preparedness
of policy entrepreneurs also play a role (Crow, 2010;
Hughes et al., 2013). Given this complexity, Pahl-Wostl et
al. (2007) argue that recognizing the unpredictability of policy
making and social learning would greatly improve the
conceptualization of water management. Nevertheless, some
dynamics persist across time and space; water management
regimes persist for decades or centuries and some transitions
in different locations share characteristics (Elshafei et al.,
2014; Kandasamy et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014). Furthermore,
modeling is a useful tool to gain insight into the impacts
of these dynamics (Thompson et al., 2013; Sivapalan and Blöschl, 2015). However, complex systems such as sociohydrological
systems cannot be modeled exhaustively (Sterman,
2000; Schlüter et al., 2014). Rather, model conceptualization
must balance sufficient process representation and
parsimony (Young et al., 1996; Ostrom, 2007).
Model conceptualization is based on general assumptions
about how a system works. Often these assumptions are implicit
and not challenged by others within the same research
community (Kuhn, 1996). This works well when research
stays within the bounds of the existing methods, theories
and goals of one’s research community; when working in
new intellectual territory, research community norms cannot
be relied upon to guide assumptions. Further disciplinary
training is highly successful at teaching these community
norms, and researchers working on interdisciplinary projects
must actively question the framing assumptions they bring
to the project (Lélé and Norgaard, 2005; McConnell et al.,
2009). By its integrative nature, socio-hydrological modeling
crosses disciplines and modelers are unable to point to
the theoretical framework of any single discipline to make
simplifying assumptions (Srinivasan, 2015). In absence of
research community norms, we must return to modeling fundamentals.
Models are simplifications of real systems that,
in a strict sense, cannot be validated but the acceptability of
model assumptions for the question at hand can be assessed
(Sterman, 2000). Careful articulation of the research questions
links the assessment of important variables and mechanisms
to the question context. This allows the critique to
focus on the acceptability of these choices relative to model
goals and enables critical assessment of the range of applicability
of identified processes through case and model comparison.
The recent Water Resources Research Debate Series offers
an excellent illustration of this point. Di Baldassarre
et al. (2015) catalyze the debate by presenting a generic
model of human–flood interaction. This model incorporates
both the “levee effect”, in which periods of infrequent flooding
(sometimes caused by flood protection infrastructure) increase
the tendency for people to settle in the floodplain, and
the “adaptation effect”, in which the occurrence of flooding
leads to an adaptive response. In the model they link flood
frequency and adaptive action through a social memory variable
which increases with the occurrence of floods and decays
slowly overtime; flood occurrence directly triggers levee
heightening in technological societies and indirectly, through
the social memory, decreases floodplain population density
(Di Baldassarre et al., 2015).
In the debate this modeling approach is both commended
as an impressive innovation and critiqued for its simplification
of social dynamics (Gober and Wheater, 2015;
Loucks, 2015; Sivapalan, 2015; Troy et al., 2015). Gober and
Wheater (2015) note that while social or collective memory
is an important factor in flood resilience it does not determine
flood response; flood awareness may or may not result in an
adaptive response based on the way individuals, the media and institutions process the flood threat, the social capacity
for adaptation and the preparedness of policy entrepreneurs,
among other factors. Loucks (2015) observes that data on
past behavior is not necessarily an indicator of future behavior
and suggests that observing stakeholder responses to
simulated water management situations may offer additional
insight. Troy et al. (2015) and Di Baldassarre et al. (2015)
note that the human–flood interaction model presented represents
a hypothesis of system dynamics which allows for
exploration, and that simple stylized models enable generalization
across space and time. In sum, the debate presents
different perspectives on the acceptability of the modeling
assumptions.
A close look at how the debate authors critique and
commend the human–flood interaction model illustrates
that the acceptability of modeling assumptions hinges
upon the model’s intended use. For example, Gober and
Wheater (2015) critique the simplicity of social memory as a
proxy for social system dynamics but acknowledge the utility
of the model in clarifying the tradeoffs of different approaches
to meet water management goals. As we can never
have comprehensive representation of a complex and coupled
human–hydrological system, we need transparency of
the abstracting assumptions and their motivation. This is not
a new insight; however, a question driven modeling process
allows the flexibility and transparency needed to examine the
acceptability of model assumptions while acknowledging the
role of context and the potential for surprise.

##2.4 A question driven modeling process
Our proposed process begins with a research question. The
research question is then used to identify the key outcome
metric(s). A dynamic hypothesis is developed to explain the
behavior of the outcome metric over time; a framework can
be used to guide and communicate the development of the
dynamic hypothesis. Remaining model processes are then
specified according to established theory.
As emphasized by both system dynamics and socialecological
systems researchers, the research question drives
the process of system abstraction. One way to think about
this process of abstraction is through the lens of forward
and backward reasoning. Schlüter et al. (2014) introduced
the idea of forward and backward reasoning to develop conceptual
models of social-ecological systems. In a backwardreasoning
approach, the question is first used to identify indicators
or outcome metrics; next, the analysis proceeds to
identify the relevant processes and then the variables and
their relationships, as seen in Fig. 1 (Schülter et al., 2014).
These three pieces then form the basis for the conceptual
model. In contrast, a forward-reasoning approach begins
with the identification of variables and relationships and then
proceeds toward outcomes. Forward reasoning is most successful
when there is expert knowledge of the system, and
backward-reasoning is useful primarily when prior knowledge

![](figure1.png)

is insufficient (Arocha et al., 1993). As few researchers
have expert knowledge of all domains involved in sociohydrological
modeling and data is often sparse, a backwardreasoning
approach is here used to conceptualize a sociohydrological
model. Additionally, this outcome-oriented approach
will focus the scope of the model on the question’s
relevant variables and processes.
The research question helps to define the outcome metric(
s) of interest; however, determining the relevant processes
and variables requires further analysis. One tool to identify
influential processes and variables is the dynamic hypothesis.
A dynamic hypothesis is a working theory, informed by
data, of how the system behavior in question arose (Sterman,
2000). It is dynamic in nature because it explains changes
in behavior over time in terms of the structure of the system
(Stave, 2003). The dynamic hypothesis could encompass the
entire socio-hydrological model, but in practice many processes
within a model will be based on established theory
such as rainfall runoff or evaporation processes. The intent is
to focus the dynamic hypothesis on a novel theory explaining
observed behavior. Stating the dynamic hypothesis clarifies
which portion of the model is being tested.
A framework can aid the development of the dynamic hypotheses
and the communication of the reasoning behind
it. The use of frameworks enhances the transparency of
model development by clearly communicating the modeler’s
broad understanding of a system. Socio-hydrological modelers
can develop their own framework (Elshafei et al., 2014)
or draw on existing frameworks that address coupled human–
hydrological systems such as the social-ecological systems
(SES) framework, the management transition framework,
or the integrated structure–actor–water framework (Ostrom,
2007; Pahl-Wostl et al., 2010; Hale et al., 2015).
To illustrate how a framework may be used in model conceptualization
we will focus on the SES framework. The SES framework is a nested conceptual map that partitions the attributes
of a social-ecological system into four broad classes:
(1) resource system, (2) resource units, (3) actors and (4) the
governance system (McGinnis and Ostrom, 2014). Each of
the four top tier variables has a series of second tier (and potentially
higher tier) variables; for example, storage characteristics
and equilibrium properties are second tier attributes
of the resource system (Ostrom, 2009). The SES framework
prescribes a set of elements and general relationships to consider
when studying coupled social and ecological systems
(Ostrom, 2011). The variables defined in the SES framework
were found to impact the interactions and outcomes of
social-ecological systems in a wide range of empirical studies
(Ostrom, 2007). In addition to specifying candidate variables,
the SES framework specifies broad process relationships
(Schlüter et al., 2014). At the broadest level, SES specifies
that the state of the resource system, governance system,
resource unit properties and actor characteristics influence
interactions and are subsequently influenced by the outcomes
of those interactions. To operationalize the SES framework
for model conceptualization one must move down a level
to assess the relevance of the tier two variables against case
data and background knowledge. This review aims to check
the dynamic hypothesis against a broader view of coupled
system dynamics and to inform determination of remaining
model processes.
The following case presents the development of a sociohydrological
(coupled) and a traditional (noncoupled) model
to illustrate this process. While this process is developed to
study real-world cases a hypothetical case is used here for
simplicity, brevity and proof of concept.

# 3 Sunshine City: a case study of reservoir operations
Sunshine City is located in a growing region in a semi-arid
climate. The region is politically stable, technologically developed,
with a market economy governed by a representative
democracy. Sunshine City draws its water supply from
the Blue River, a large river which it shares with downstream
neighbors. The water users must maintain a minimum flow
in the Blue River for ecological health. Sunshine City can
draw up to 25% of the annual flow of the Blue River in any
given year. A simple prediction of the year’s flow is made by
assuming that the flow will be equal to the previous year’s
flow; the resulting errors are corrected by adjusting the next
year’s withdrawal.

![](table1.png)

The city’s Water Utility is responsible for diverting, treating
and transporting water to city residents and businesses.
It is also tasked with making infrastructure investment decisions,
setting water prices. Water users receive plentiful supply
at cost and there have been no shortages in recent years.
While located in a semi-arid environment, the large size of
Sunshine City’s Blue River water availability and allocation
created a comfortable buffer. The city’s Water Utility is also responsible for setting water efficiency codes and other conservation
rules. The current building code includes only basic
efficiencies required by the national government. The Blue
River, along with other regional sources, is fully allocated
making future augmentation of supplies unlikely. See Table 1
above for a summary of key characteristics of Sunshine City.
Along with the rest of the region, Sunshine City’s population,
and its water demand, has grown rapidly over the past
few years. Managers at the Water Utility are concerned they
will no longer be able to meet its reliability targets as demands
rise and have added a reservoir to increase future reliability.
They now must decide how to operate the reservoir
and are considering two options: standard operating policy
(SOP) and hedging policy (HP). The selected operating policy
must satisfy downstream user rights and maintain minimum
ecological flows. In addition to meeting the legal requirements,
the Water Utility managers are concerned with
finding a policy that will enable the city to provide the most
reliable water supply throughout the lifetime of the reservoir
(50–100 years). From experience they have observed that
both water price and reliability affect demand. A key puzzle
that emerges for water managers from this experience is:
how do operational rules governing use of water storage influence
long-term water supply reliability when consumers
make water usage decisions based on both price and reliability?
As the question implies, the Water Utility managers have
a working hypothesis relating demand change with water
shortages. Therefore, along with the research question the
following dynamic hypothesis is considered: the occurrence
of water shortages increases the tendency of users to adopt
water conservation technologies and to make long-term behavioral
changes. HP triggers shortages sooner than SOP
thus triggering earlier decreases in demand.

![](figure2.png)

##3.1 Background
The decision of how much water to release for use each time
period is deceptively complex due to the uncertainty of future
streamflows and the nonlinear benefits of released water
(Shih and ReVelle, 1994; Draper and Lund, 2004). In making
release decisions, water utilities must fulfill their mandate
to maintain a reliable water supply in a fiscally efficient
manner. Reliability is the probability that the system is in
a satisfactory state (Hashimoto et al., 1982). In this case, a
satisfactory system state is one in which all demands on the
system can be met. The definition of an unsatisfactory state
is more nuanced. Water shortages have a number of characteristics
that are important to water management including
frequency, maximum shortage in a given time period, and
length of shortage period (Cancelliere et al., 1998). Longterm
reliability here refers to the projected reliability over
several decades. The time frame used for long-term projections
varies between locations and utilities (i.e., Boston uses
a 25-year time frame, Denver uses a 40-year time frame, and
Las Vegas uses a 50-year time frame) and a 50-year time
frame is used here (MWRA, 2003; SNWA, 2009; Denver
Water, 2015).
Two operational policies, SOP and HP, are commonly used
to address this decision problem. Under SOP, demand is always
fulfilled unless available supply drops below demand;
under HP, water releases are limited in anticipation of an expected
deficit (Cancelliere et al., 1998). Hedging is used as
a way to decrease the risk of a large shortfall by imposing
conservation while stored water remains available. Figures 2
and 3 illustrate SOP and HP, respectively. For this simple experiment
only linear hedging, where KP is the slope of the
release function, is tested.
The traditional argument for hedging is that it is economical
to allow a small deficit in the current time period in order
to decrease the probability of a more severe shortage in a future
time periods (Bower et al., 1962). This argument holds
true if the loss function associated with a water shortage is

![](figure3.png)

nonlinear and convex; in other words that a severe shortage
has a larger impact than the sum of several smaller shortages
(Shih and ReVelle, 1994). Gal (1979) showed that the
water shortage loss function is convex, thereby proving the
utility of hedging as a drought management strategy. Other
researchers have shown that hedging effectively reduces the
maximum magnitude of water shortages and increases total
utility over time (Shih and ReVelle, 1994; Cancelliere et al.,
1998). More recent work by Draper and Lund (2004) and
You and Cai (2008) confirms previous findings and demonstrates
the continued relevance reservoir operation policy selection.
Researchers and water system managers have for decades
sought improved policies for reservoir operation during
drought periods (Bower et al., 1962; Shih and ReVelle, 1994;
You and Cai, 2008). We add to this classic question the observation
that water shortages influence both household conservation
technology adoption rates and water use behavior.
In agreement with Giacomoni et al. (2013), we hypothesize
that the occurrence of water shortages increases the
tendency of users to adopt water conservation technologies
and to make long-term behavioral changes. Household water
conservation technologies include low flow faucets, shower
heads and toilets, climatically appropriate landscaping, grey
water recycling and rainwater harvesting systems (Schuetze
and Santiago-Fandiño, 2013). The adoption rates of these
technologies are influenced by a number of factors including
price, incentive programs, education campaigns and peer
adoption (Campbell et al., 2004; Kenney et al., 2008). A review
of studies in the US, Australia and UK showed that
the installation of conservation technologies results in indoor
water savings of 9–12% for fixture retrofits and 35–50%
for comprehensive appliance replacements (Inman and Jeffrey,
2006). In some cases offsetting behavior reduces these
potential gains; however, even with offsetting, the adoption
of conservation technologies still results in lower per capita
demands (Geller et al., 1983; Fielding et al., 2012). Water
use behavior encompasses the choices that individuals
make related to water use ranging from length of showers

![](table2.png)

and frequency of running the dishwasher to timing of lawn
watering and frequency of car washing. Water use behavior
is shaped by knowledge of the water system, awareness of
conservation options and their effectiveness, and consumer’s
attitudes toward conservation (Frick et al., 2004; Willis et
al., 2011). Changes to water use behavior can be prompted
by price increases, education campaigns, conservation regulations
and weather (Campbell et al., 2004; Kenney et al.,
2008; Olsmtead and Stavins, 2009).
As a city begins to experience a water shortage, the water
utility may implement water restrictions, price increases,
incentive programs or education campaigns to influence consumer
behavior. While staff within the water utility or city
may have planned these measures before, the occurrence of
a water shortage event, particularly if it aligns with other
driving forces, offers a window of opportunity to implement
sustainable water management practices (Jones and Baumgartner,
2005; Hughes et al., 2013). In addition, water users
are more likely to respond to these measures with changes
in their water use behavior and/or adoption of conservation
technologies during shortages. Baldassare and Katz (1992)
examined the relationship between the perception of risk to
personal well-being from an environmental threat and adoption
of environmental practices with a personal cost (financial
or otherwise). They found that the perceived level of environmental
threat is a better predictor for individual environmental
action, including water conservation, than demographic
variables or political factors. Illustrating this effect,
Mankad and Tapsuwan (2011) found that adoption of alternative
water technologies, such as on-site treatment and reuse,
is increased by the perception of risk from water scarcity.
Evidence of individual level behavior change can also be
seen in the results of a 2013 national water policy survey conducted
by the Institute for Science, Technology and Public
Policy at Texas A&M University. The survey sampled over
3000 adults from across the United States about their attitudes
and actions related to a variety of water resources and
public policy issues. Included in the survey were questions
that asked respondents how recently, if ever, they personally experienced a water shortage and which, if any, household
efficiency upgrade or behavioral change actions their
household had taken in the past year. Efficiency upgrade options
offered included low-flow shower heads, low-flush toilets
and changes to landscaping; behavioral options given included
shorter showers, less frequent dishwasher or washing
machine use, less frequent car washing and changes to
yard watering (ISTPP, 2013). As seen in Table 2, respondents
who had recently experienced a water shortage were
more likely to have made efficiency investments and to have
changed their water use behavior. This finding is corroborated
by a recent survey of Colorado residents. Of the 72%of
respondents reporting increased attention to water issues, the
most-cited reason for the increase (26% of respondents) was
a recent drought or dry year (BBC Research, 2013). Other
reasons cited by an additional 25% of respondents including
news coverage, water quantity issues and population growth
may also be related water shortage concerns or experiences.
The increased receptivity of the public to water conservation
measures and the increased willingness of water users
to go along with these measures during shortage events combine
to drive changes in per capita demands. The combined
effect of these two drivers was demonstrated in a study
of the Arlington, Texas, water supply system (Giacomoni
et al., 2013; Kanta and Zechman, 2014). Additional examples
of city- and regional-scale drought response leading to
long-term demand decreases include the droughts of 1987–
1991 and the mid-2000s in California and of 1982–1983 and
1997–2009 in Australia (Zilberman et al., 1992; Turral, 1998;
Sivapalan et al., 2012; Hughes et al., 2013). It is often difficult
to separate the relative effects of the multiple price
and nonprice approaches applied by water utilities during
droughts (Olmstead and Stavins, 2009). The point is, however,
that the response generally points to lower per capita
water demands.
One example of lasting water use reductions after a shortage
is the 1987–1992 drought in Los Angeles, California. An
extensive public awareness and education campaign sparked
both behavioral changes and the adoption of efficient fixtures
such as low-flow shower heads and toilets and increasing
block pricing introduced after the drought helped maintain
conservation gains (LADWP, 2010). Evidence of the lasting
effect can be seen in Fig. 4. Per capita water demands do not
return to 1990 levels after the drought ends in 1992. Note that
the data below also contains a counter example. The 1976–
1977 drought caused a sharp drop in water consumption in
Los Angeles; however, consumption quickly returned to predrought
levels when the rainfall returned in 1978. While the
1976–1977 drought was more intense than any year in the
1987–1992 drought, the long duration of the later drought
caused deeper draw downs in the city’s water reserves ultimately
prompting transformative action (LADWP, 2010).
This may indicate that the impact of the 1976–1977 drought
was below the threshold for significant action or that other
priorities dominated public attention and resources at the

![](figure4.png)

time. In sum, the Los Angeles case serves both to illustrate
that hydrological change can prompt long-term changes in
water demands and as a reminder that multiple factors influence
water demands and hydrological events will not always
dominate.

##3.2 Model development

The Sunshine City water managers want to understand how
the operational rules governing use of water storage influence
long-term water supply reliability when consumers make water
usage decisions based on price and reliability. A model
can help the managers gain insight into system’s behavior
by computing the consequences of reservoir operation policy
choice over time and under different conditions. As described
in the background section, many supply side and demand
side factors affect water system reliability. However,
not all variables and processes are relevant for a given question.
A question driven modeling process uses the question to
determine model boundary and scope rather than beginning
with a prior understanding of the important variables and processes.
A question driven process is here used to determine
the appropriate level of system abstraction for the Sunshine
City reservoir operations model.
From the research question it is clear that reliability is the
outcome metric of interest and that the model must test for
the hypothesized link between demand changes and reliability.
Reliability, as defined above, is the percent of time that all
demands can be met. The SES framework is used to guide the
selection of processes and variables, including the dynamic
hypothesis. Given this wide range, the framework was then
compared against the variables and processes found to be influential
in urban water management and socio-hydrological
studies (Brezonik and Stadelmann, 2002; Abrishamchi et al.,
2005; Padowski and Jawitz, 2012; Srinivasan et al., 2013;
Dawadi and Ahmad, 2013; Elshafei et al., 2014; Gober et al.,
2014; Liu et al., 2014; Pande et al., 2013; van Emmerik et
al., 2014). Based on this evaluation two second tier variables
were added to the framework: land use to the resource system characteristics and water demand to interactions; other variables
were modified to reflect the language typically used
in the water sciences (i.e., supply in place of harvesting).
See Table 3 for urban water specific modification of the SES
framework.
We then assess the relevance of the tier two variables
against case data and background knowledge (summarized
in Sects. 3 and 3.1, respectively) by beginning with the outcome
metric, reliability. Within the framework reliability is
an outcome variable, specifically a social performance metric,
and it is the direct result of water supply and water demand
interaction processes. Water supply encompasses the
set of utility level decisions on reservoir withdrawals and
discharges. As detailed in the case description, these decisions
are shaped by the selected reservoir operating policy,
streamflow, the existing environmental flow and downstream
allocation requirements, reservoir capacity, water in storage
and water demands. Streamflow is a stochastic process that
is a function of many climatic, hydraulic and land surface
parameters. However, given the driving question and the assumption
that the city represents only a small portion of the
overall watershed, a simple statistical representation is sufficient
and streamflow is assumed independent of other model
variables.
Total water demand is a function of both population and
per capita demand. As described in the background section,
per capita water demand changes over time in response to
household level decisions to adopt more water efficient technologies
and water use behavior change made by individuals
in each time interval; these decisions may be influenced by
conservation policies. As conditions change water users reassess
the situation and, if they choose to act, decide between
available options such as investment in efficient technology,
changing water use behavior and, in extreme cases, relocation.
Therefore, per capita demand is a function of price and
historic water reliability as well as available technologies,
and water user’s perception of the water system. Since the
focus of the question is on system wide reliability individual
level decisions can be modeled in the aggregate as total
demand, which is also influenced by population. Population
increases in proportion to the current population, as
regional economic growth is the predominant driver of migration
trends. However, in extreme cases, perceptions of resource
limitations can also influence growth rates. The SES
variables used in the conceptual model are highlighted in Table
3 and the resulting processes are summarized in Fig. 5.
Only a subset of the variables and processes articulated in
the SES framework are included in the conceptual model;
other variables and processes were considered but not included.
For example, economic development drives increasing
per capita water demands in many developing regions
but the relationship between economic growth and water demands
in highly developed regions is weaker due to the increased
cost of supply expansion and greater pressure for
environmental protection (Gleick, 2000). The income elas

![](table3.png)


![](figure5.png)

![](table4.png)

ticity of water can lead to increased water demands if rates
do not change proportionally (Dalhuisen et al., 2003); here
prices are assumed to keep pace with inflation. Given this
assumption, and the focus on a city in a developed region,
economic development likely plays a minor role. Similarly,
group decision-making and planning processes such as public
forums, voting and elections can shape the responses to
reliability changes over time. This model aims to answer a
question about the impact of a policy not the ease or likelihood
of its implementation. Once the policy is established
through whatever process that is used, the question here focuses
on its efficacy. Therefore, group decision-making processes
need not be included.
In addition to determining the appropriate level of detail
of the conceptual model, we must determine which variables
change in response to forces outside the model scope (exogenous
variables), which variables must be modeled endogenously
(state variables) and which can be considered constants
(parameters). Again the nature of the question along
with the temporal and spatial scale informs these distinctions.
Variables such as stored water volume, per capita water demand
and shortage awareness will clearly change over the
50-year study period. The population of the city is also expected
to change over the study period. Under average hydrological
conditions the population growth rate is expected
to be driven predominately by regional economic forces exogenous
to the system; however, under extreme conditions
water supply reliability can influence the growth rate. Therefore,
population is considered a state variable. Streamflow...

##3.3 Results
The model was run for SOP (KP D 1) and three levels of HP
where level one (KP D 1:5) is the least conservative, level
two (KP D 2) is slightly more conservative and level three
(KP D 3) is the most conservative hedging rule tested. Three
trials were conducted with a constant parameter set to understand
the system variation driven by the stochastic streamflow
sequence and to test if the relationship hypothesized
was influential across hydrological conditions. For each trial
streamflow, reservoir storage, shortage awareness, per capita
demand, population and total demand were recorded and
plotted. As a comparison, each trial was also run in the noncoupled
model in which demand and population changes are
exogenous.
In the first trial, shown in Fig. 6a, there were two sustained
droughts in the study period: from years 5 to 11 and
then from years 33 to 37. Higher than average flows in the
years preceding the first drought allowed the utility to build
up stored water as seen in Fig. 6b. The storage acts as a buffer
and the impacts are not passed along to the water users until
year 18 under SOP. Under HP the impacts, as well as water
users’ shortage awareness, increase in years 15, 13 and
12 based on the level of the hedging rule (slope of KP/ applied,
as shown in Fig. 6c. The impact of this rising shortage
awareness on per capita water demands is seen in the acceleration
of the decline in demands in Fig. 6d. This demand
decrease is driven by city level policy changes such as price
increases and voluntary restrictions in combination with increased
willingness to conserve.
The impacts of this decrease on individual water users will
depend on their socio-economic characteristics as well as the
particular policies implemented. While the aggregation hides
this heterogeneity, it should be considered in the interpretation
of these results. The increased shortage awareness also
has a small dampening effect on population growth during
and directly after the first drought (Fig. 6e). Changes to both
per capita demands and population result in total demand
changes (see Fig. 6f). After the first drought the system begins
to recover under each of the three hedging policies as
evidenced by the slow increase in reservoir storage. However,
as streamflows fluctuate around average streamflow and
total demands now surpass the average allocation, reservoir
storage does not recover when no hedging restrictions are

![](figure6.png)

imposed. Several years of above average flow ending in year
29 drive further recovery. The second prolonged drought has
the most pronounced effect under the SOP scenario. Shortage
impacts are drastic, driving further per capita demand
decreases and a temporary decline in population. A slight
population decrease is also seen under level one hedging but
the results demonstrate that all hedging strategies dampen the
effect.
In the second trial there are two brief droughts in the beginning
of the study period, beginning in years 4 and 10, as
seen in Fig. 7a. Under SOP and the first two hedging policies
there is no change in operation for the first drought and the
reservoir is drawn down to compensate as seen in Fig. 7a–b.
Only under the level three HP are supplies restricted, triggering
an increase in shortage awareness and a subsequent
decrease in per capita demands, as found in Fig. 7c and d.
When the prolonged drought begins in year 20, the four scenarios
have very different starting points. Under SOP, there
is less than 0.5 km3 of water in storage and total annual demands
are approximately 0.65 km3. In contrast, under the
level three HP there is 1.4 km3 of water in storage and total
annual demands are just under 0.6 km3. Predictably, the
impacts of the drought are both delayed and softened under
HP. As the drought is quite severe, all scenarios result in a
contraction of population. However, the rate of decrease and
total population decrease is lowered by the use of HP.
In the third and final trial there is no significant low flow
period until year 36 of the simulation when a moderate
drought event occurs, as shown in Fig. 8a. Earlier in the
simulation minor fluctuations in streamflow only trigger an
acceleration of per capita demand declines under the level
three HP, as seen in Fig. 8c and d. A moderate drought begins
in year 36. However, the reservoir levels drop and shortage
awareness rise starting before year 20, as seen in Fig. 8b and
c. Then when the drought occurs the impacts are far greater
than in the comparably moderate drought in trial 1 because a
prolonged period of steady water supply enabled population
growth and placed little pressure on the population to reduce
demands. In the SOP scenario, the system was in shortage before
the drought occurred and total demands peaked in year
30 at 0.82 km3. The subsequent drought exacerbated an existing
problem and accelerated changes already in motion.
Figure 9 presents results of the noncoupled model simulation.
While the control model was also run for all three trials,
the results of only trial three are included here for brevity.
In the noncoupled model, HP decreases water withdrawals
as reservoir levels drop and small shortages are seen early
in the study period, as seen in Fig. 9b and c. In the second
half of the study period significant shortages are observed, as
in Fig. 9c. However, inspection of the streamflow sequence
reveals no severe low flow periods indicating that the shortages
are driven by increasing demands, as in Fig. 9a. As expected, changes to per capita demands, population, and total
demands are gradual and consistent across the operating policy
scenarios, found in Fig. 9e and f.

#4 Discussion
The proposed question driven modeling process has three
aims: to broaden the researcher’s view of the system, to
connect modeling assumptions to the model’s purpose and
to increase the transparency of these assumptions. A sociohydrological
model was developed to examine the difference
in long-term reliability between two reservoir operating
policies, SOP and HP. This question focused the conceptual
model on processes influencing reliability at the city scale
over the 50-year planning period. As part of the conceptual
model development, the SES framework was used to check
framing assumptions. The wide range of candidate variables
included in the SES framework was reviewed against case
data and background information. The model’s intended use
then informed decisions of which processes to include in the
model, which processes were endogenous to the system and
which variables could be held constant. The point here is not
that the logic presented by the modeler using this process
is unfailing but that it is clear and can inform debate. The
questions raised about both the functional form of model relationships and the variables excluded during the manuscript
review process indicate that some transparency was achieved.
However, the reader is in the best position to judge success
on this third aim.
A socio-hydrological model of the Sunshine City water
system was developed using the question driven modeling
process and compared to a noncoupled model. The noncoupled
model included assumes that both population growth
and per capita demand change can be considered exogenous
to the system. Both models show, as prior studies demonstrated,
that by making small reductions early on HP reduces
the chance of severe shortages. The socio-hydrological
model also demonstrates that in the HP scenarios the moderate
low flow events trigger an acceleration of per capita
demand decrease that shifts the trajectory of water demands
and in some instances slows the rate of population growth.
In contrast, SOP delays impacts to the water consumers and
therefore delays the shift to lower per capita demands. When
extreme shortage events, such as a deep or prolonged drought
occur, the impacts to the system are far more abrupt in the
SOP scenario because per capita demands and population are
higher than in hedging scenarios and there is less stored water
available to act as a buffer. When we compare SOP and HP
using a socio-hydrological model we see that HP decreases
the magnitude of the oscillations in demand and population.
Hedging reduces the threshold for action, thereby decreasing
the delay and the oscillation effect. This distinction between
the two policies was not apparent when using a traditional
noncoupled model. The significance of this observation is
that a decrease in oscillation means a decrease in the magnitude
of the contractions in population and per capita water
demands required to maintain sustainability of the system. It
is these abrupt changes in water usage and population that
water utilities and cities truly want to avoid as they would
hamper economic growth and decrease quality of life.
Examining the structure of the system can explain the differences
in system response to SOP and HP. As seen in Fig. 5,
there are one positive and two negative feedback loops in the
system. Positive feedback loops, such as population in this
model, exhibit exponential growth behavior but there are few
truly exponential growth systems in nature and through interaction
with other feedback loops most systems ultimately
reach a limit (Sterman, 2000). Negative feedback loops generate
goal seeking behavior. In its simplest form a negative
feedback loop produces a slow approach to a limit or goal
akin to an exponential decay function. In this case, the goal
of the system is to match total demand with average supply.
The fact that supply is driven by streamflow, a stochastic
variable, adds noise to the system. Even if streamflow is correctly
characterized with stationary statistics, as is assumed
here, the variability challenges the management of the system.
Reservoir storage helps utilities manage this variability
by providing a buffer but it also acts as a delay. The delay
between a change in the state of the system and action taken
in response allows the system to overshoot its goal value before
corrective action is taken, leading to oscillation around
goal values. While water storage decreases the impact of a
drought, changes to water consumption patterns are required
to address demand driven shortages. Water storage simultaneously
buffers variability and delays water user response by
delaying impact. There are parallels between the feedback
identified in this urban water supply system and the feedback
identified by Elshafei et al. (2014) and Di Baldassarre (2013)
in agricultural water management and human–flood interactions,
respectively. Broadly, the three systems display the balance
between the interaction between opposing forces, in this
case articulated as positive and negative feedback loops.
The case of Sunshine City is simplified and perhaps simplistic.
The limited number of available options for action
constrains the system and shapes the observed behavior. In
many cases water utilities have a portfolio of supply, storage
and demand management policies to minimize shortages.
Additionally, operating policies often shift in response
to changing conditions. However, in this case no supply side
projects are considered and the reservoir operating policy is
assumed constant throughout the duration of the study period.
As there are physical and legal limits to available supplies
the first constraint reflects the reality of some systems.
Constant operational policy is a less realistic constraint but
can offer new insights by illustrating the limitations of maintaining a given policy and the conditions in which policy
change would be beneficial. Despite these drawbacks a simple
hypothetical model is justified here to clearly illustrate
the proposed modeling process.
There are several limitations to the hypothetical case of
Sunshine City. First, the hypothetical nature of the case precludes
hypothesis testing. Therefore, an important extension
of this work will be to apply the modeling process presented
here on a real case to fully test the resulting model
against historical observations before generating projections.
Second, only one set of parameters and functions was presented.
Future extensions to this work on reservoir policy
selection will test the impact of parameter and function selection
through sensitivity analysis. Finally, we gain limited
understanding of the potential of the model development process
by addressing only one research question. We can further
test the ability of the modeling process to generate new
insights by developing different models in response to different
questions. In this case, the narrow scope of the driving
question leads to a model that just scratches the surface
of socio-hydrological modeling as evidenced by the narrow
range of societal variables and processes included. For example,
this model does not address the ability of the water utility
or city to adopt or implement HP. HP impacts water users in
the short term. These impacts would likely generate a mix
of reactions from water users and stakeholders making it impossible
to ignore politics when considering the feasibility of
HP. However, the question driving this model asks about the
impact of a policy choice on the long-term reliability of the
system not the feasibility of its implementation. A hypothesis
addressing the feasibility of implementation would lead
to a very different model structure.
While there is significant room for improvement, there are
inherent limitations to any approach that models human behavior.
The human capacity to exercise free will, to think
creatively and to innovate means that human actions, particularly
under conditions not previously experienced, are fundamentally
unpredictable. Furthermore, as stated above we can
never fully capture the complexity of the socio-hydrological
system in a model. Instead we propose a modeling process
that focuses socio-hydrological model conceptualization on
answering questions and solving problems. By using model
purpose to drive our modeling decisions we provide justification
for simplifying assumptions and a basis for model
evaluation.

#5 Conclusion
Human and water systems are coupled. The feedback between
these two subsystems can be, but are not always,
strong and fast enough to warrant consideration in water
planning and management. Traditional, noncoupled, modeling
techniques assume that there is no significant feedback
between human and hydrological systems. They therefore offer no insights into how changes in one part of the system
may affect another. Dynamic socio-hydrological modeling
recognizes and aims to understand the potential for feedbacks
between human and hydrological systems. By building
human dynamics into a systems model, socio-hydrological
modeling enables testing of hypothesized feedback cycles
and can illuminate the way changes propagate through the
coupled system.
Recent work examining a range of socio-hydrological
systems demonstrates the potential of this approach. However,
there are significant challenges to modeling sociohydrological
systems. First, there are no widely accepted
laws of human systems as there are for physical or chemical
systems. Second, common disciplinary assumptions must be
questioned due to the integrative nature of socio-hydrology.
Transparency of the model development process and assumptions
can facilitate the replication and critique needed to
move this young field forward. We assess the progress and
gaps in socio-hydrological modeling and draw lessons from
adjacent fields of study, hydrology, social-ecological systems
science and system dynamics, to inform a question driven
model development process. We then illustrate this process
by applying it to the hypothetical case of a growing city exploring
two alternate reservoir operation rules.
By revisiting the classic question of reservoir operation
policy, we demonstrate the utility of a socio-hydrological
modeling process in generating new insights into the impacts
of management practices over decades. This sociohydrological
model shows that HP offers an advantage not
detected by traditional simulation models: it decreases the
magnitude of the oscillation effect inherent in goal seeking
systems with delays. Through this example we identify one
class of question, the impact of reservoir management policy
selection over several decades, for which socio-hydrological
modeling offers advantages over traditional modeling. The
model developed, and the resulting insights, are contingent
upon the question context. The dynamics identified here may
be more broadly applicable but this is for future cases and
models to assess.
